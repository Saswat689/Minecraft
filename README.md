# Minecraft using the Ursina Game Engine :rocket:

In the recent days I was learning Python and one thing I stumbled upon was this easy to use game engine called [Ursina](https://www.ursinaengine.org/documentation.html)

## Playing The Game

Running this game is super easy.

- Clone the repo
- Double click on minecraft.bat file to execute them.

That's it.

There are a couple of features of this game:

- Change bricks by typing number: 1,2,3,4 and 5;
- Create and destroy bricks by using left and right mouse buttons.
- Move by using W(forward),D(Right),A(Left) and S(Backward)
- Jump by pressing space
- Sound effects while creating,destroying applications.
